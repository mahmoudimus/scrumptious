# Scrumptious

An example [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) application that attempts to build
a website URL aggregator while exploring different parts of Ember

## How?

I used this tutorial [Let's Learn Ember by TutsPlus](https://tutsplus.com/course/lets-learn-ember/)
to build this application.

## Why?

Some of the tutorial was a bit out-dated as
[ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) and [ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js)
both had significant updates and this changed the code a bit, so I thought this
would be helpful for others to see what I did.
